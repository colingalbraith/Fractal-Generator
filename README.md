# 2D Fractal Generator

A 2D fractal generator made in python that allows the user to zoom in/out of fractals that are color coded based on iteration. The program allows the user to explore
the rational, julia and mandelbrot set. The program uses Pygame for graphics, numpy for computation and numba to increase speed.
---
## Features

- **Fractal Types**: Generate and explore Mandelbrot, Julia, and Rational fractals.
- **Interactive Interface**: Zoom and pan across the fractals for an immersive experience.
- **Efficient Computation**: Uses the Numba library for speed optimization, ensuring fast fractal generation.
- **Color-Coded Iterations**: Colorful rendering of fractals based on the number of iterations.
- **Switch Fractals**: Easily switch between different fractal types using on-screen buttons.
- **Reset Zoom**: Reset the zoom level to return to the initial view with a click of a button.
